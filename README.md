The Movie Database Web Application is a frontend project that utilizes HTML and CSS for the user interface and JavaScript for the backend functionality. It integrates with the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display movie-related information. The primary goal of the project is to allow users to search for movies, view movie details, and discover popular and trending films.
